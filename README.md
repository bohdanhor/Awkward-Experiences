# Division of Labour & Benefits — The Most Annoying Website™

A satirical HTML/CSS/JavaScript site demonstrating intentionally awkward and disruptive UX patterns.  
Includes click-triggered audio, constant confirmation prompts, dark-mode chaos, intrusive modals, and a mock job board with a fake checkout.

## Quick start
Open `index.html` in a browser, or serve the folder with any static web server.

## Features
- **Click noise gremlin** – plays a sound every other click  
- **Link confirm gate** – prompts before any navigation  
- **Chaotic dark mode** – flickers between theme colours before settling  
- **Cookie → Tea modal** – asks for cookies, then offers tea  
- **Recurring “Loading” popup** – appears at set intervals with random event images  
- **Jobs catalogue** – static job data rendered dynamically  
- **Cart with localStorage** – adds/removes jobs and groups duplicates  
- **Silly checkout overlay** – parody form with playful inputs

## Pages
- `index.html` – Landing page with image credit, sliders, and alerts  
- `jobs.html` – Dynamic job list with “Apply” buttons  
- `cart.html` – Selected jobs with quantity controls and checkout overlay  
- `credits.html` – Image attributions and honourable mentions

## Tech stack
- HTML5  
- CSS3 (variables & dark mode)  
- JavaScript (ES6)  
- jQuery 3.7.1  
- Media assets stored in `/media`

## Workflow
